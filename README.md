<h1 align="center">Hi üëã I'm Piwani</h1>

# üí´ About Me:
I am a final-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Cape Town, with a passion for robotics, control systems, coding, machine learning, IoT, and embedded systems. My goal is to combine these fields to create innovative, high-performance solutions that push the boundaries of automation and intelligence.

## üöÄ What I'm Currently Working On:
- ü§ñ Exploring Optimization and Modeling using [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/).
- üìçüó∫Ô∏è Developing a route planner for autonomous navigation.
- üîß Embedded Systems Development: Working with ESP32, Raspberry Pi Zero, and STM32 for IoT and robotics applications.

Check out my [portfolio](https://txddy-p.github.io/piwani.github.io/) to learn more about my projects and experiences.
